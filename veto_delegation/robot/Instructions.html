<p>
For Part Two we will ask you to make a decision as a Seller, with a separate decision for each of the three types of urn. 
However, in each of the three decisions, you will be matched with a Robot Buyer. The Robot Buyer will draw an ideal quantity X from the relevant urn, but has been programmed to purchase the number of widgets that gives the Robot Buyer the highest possible payoff.
</p>
<p>
 If you are selected for Payment in Part Two, one of your three decisions will be randomly selected. We will fairly draw an ideal quantity X for the Robot Buyer from the given urn, and the Robot Buyer will then make a purchase choice from the widget options you selected that maximizes the Robot Buyer's payoff. If selected for payment in Part Two, your payoff will be $8 plus $4 for every widget purchased by the Robot Buyer.

</p>
<p>
Taking on the role of the Seller, please make a decision for each type of urn.
