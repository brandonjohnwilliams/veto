<p>
For Part two we will ask everyone to make a decision as a Seller for each of the three types of urn. However, in each of the three decisions, you will be matched with a Robot Buyer. The Robot buyer has been programmed to purchase the number of widgets that will give them the largest possible payoff.
</p>
<p>
Please now make a decision as the Seller for each type of urn. If you are selected for Payment in Part Two, one of these three decisions will be randomly selected for Payment, where we will draw an ideal value X for the Robot from the given urn, and have the Robot make the choice that maximizes the Buyers payoff.
