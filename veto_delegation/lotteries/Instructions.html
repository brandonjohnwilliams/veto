<p>
In Part Three you will be offered six different choice problems. If you are selected for payment in Part Three, we will randomly select one of your six decisions for payment; whichever choice you made in that randomly selected problem will be implemented for payment.</p>

<p> For each of the six different choice problems, we will offer you a choice across four lotteries, with a tradeoff between risk and reward.
    <ul>
        <li> Lottery A will always be the safest lottery, where the lowest possible prize from the lottery always exceeds $8.</li>
        <li> Lotteries B, C and D have an increasing chance of the lowest prize ($8).</li>
        <li> However, Lotteries B, C and D will also have increasing chances of higher prize amounts.</li>
        <li> Lottery D will always be the riskiest lottery of the four, with the largest probability on the lowest prize ($8).</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>To help you make your choice here, as you click on each lottery, we will illustrate the chances of each prize amount in a graph. Once you are happy with you choice for each round you should hit "Next".</p>
