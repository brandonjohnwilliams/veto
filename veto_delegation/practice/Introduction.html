    To help you with the experiment, we will now have a series of comprehension questions. You must successfully complete the comprehension questions in order to advance to the main experiment.
      For each practice, the screen will provide you with a review of the relevant information. Then you will answer questions regarding the information provided.

<p>
  Remember, if you have any questions during this part or the experiment, please raise your hand and someone will come to answer your question in private.
