<p>
In Part Four we will offer you a series of three choices that allow you to allocate some money for yourself and some money for another randomly chosen participant in the room.
The choices vary in the amount that you receive and the amount that the other person will receive.
Your job is just to choose the allocation that you would prefer.
If you are selected in Part Four, one of your choices will be randomly selected, and we will give the money to you and to another participant in the room based on the allocation you selected.
    The people selected in Part Four will be different from the people selected in Parts Two and Three.
