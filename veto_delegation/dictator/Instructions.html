<p>
Finally, for Part Four we will select two different participants, a decision maker and a beneficiary. Across four rounds, we will ask you to act as the decision maker, making a choice over a monetary allocation between yourself and another random participant as the beneficiary. The choices in each round will vary over the amount that you receive as the decision maker, and the amount that the beneficiary will receive.</p>

<p>Your job in each round is simply to choose one of the four allocations.</p>

    
<p>If you are selected as the decision maker in Part Four, we will randomly select one of the four rounds, and will implement the allocation you chose between yourself (as decision maker) and the other participant (as the beneficiary).</p>
    
<p>If you are instead selected as the beneficiary in Part Four we will implement a choice made by another participant (the decision maker), where you will receive the beneficiary amount they chose. </p>
