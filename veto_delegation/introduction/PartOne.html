            Buyers have an ideal number of widgets <b>X</b> that they want to purchase, drawn at random from an urn.
            Buyers will know the value of X before they make their decisions; however, Sellers will not know the Buyerâ€™s ideal quantity X, only the urn it was drawn from.
            You will see an example of the urn and the draw in a moment.
