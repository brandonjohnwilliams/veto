<ul>
  <li>
    There are fifteen rounds in total for Part One. After the fifteen rounds, we will give you additional Instructions for Parts Two, Three, and Four.
  </li>
  <li>
    At the start of the experiment half of the participants in this room will initially become Sellers and the other half will become Buyers. </li>
  <ul>
    <li>You will remain in your initial Buyer/Seller role for five rounds</li>
    <li>Every five rounds you will switch roles; Buyers becoming Sellers, and vice versa.</li>
    <li>In every new round the participant you are matched with will change. So in every new round you will be rematched into a different Buyer-Seller pair than the previous round.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    One round from the fifteen in Part One will be randomly and fairly selected for payment.
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>The randomly selected round will be used for all payment for all participants in the room. As such, you should treat every round as if it is the one that will be selected for payment for both you and the other matched participant as the Buyer or Seller in that round.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    {{ if chat == 1 }} The experiment is anonymous, and at no point will you find out which participants you have engaged with. While you are free to use the chats in any way you wish with respect to the Buyer-Seller task, we ask that you not reveal any identifying information to other participants.
    {{ else }} The experiment is anonymous, and at no point will you find out which participants you have engaged with.
    {{ endif }}
