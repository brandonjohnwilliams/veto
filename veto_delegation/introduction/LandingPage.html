  <p>
The purpose of this research study is to understand how people make decisions.
    The study involves questions and tasks.
    It should take less than 60 minutes to do the study.
    You must be at least 18 years old.
The instructions will describe your task, the payoff schedule, and how it depends on your decisions, the decisions of others, and chance.
Your minimum possible earnings for completing the experiment are $16.
    Your additional earnings may be affected by your individual decisions, decisions of others, and chance.
    On average you could get another $15 in earnings, but it could be more or less.

    <p>

    Your responses will be anonymous and will not be identifiable in any way.
    Your participation is completely voluntary.
  You may discontinue participation at any time during the research activity.
  If you choose not to participate, you still receive the show up payment of $8.
Your current and future status with the University of Pittsburgh and any other benefits for which you qualify will be the same whether you participate in this study or not.
